# WacomRipOff_Teensy
WacomRipOff project ported on Teensy++ 2.0  
ported from WacomRipOff project [here](https://github.com/TiNredmc/WacomRipoff)  


Most of this code is working in the same manner likes STM32, except that instead of using interrupt (which is really buggy here in Arduino). I workaround-ed with the polling instead, but the outcome is no different.
